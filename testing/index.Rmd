Data analysis is only useful if it's correct, and if it's not, it [can do considerable harm](https://theconversation.com/the-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646).
While no amount of testing can ever conclusively prove that there aren't mistakes in code, a few simple practices can reassure us that it's probably all right.
This tutorial will introduce some of the tools R gives you for checking your code and show you how to integrate them into your workflow.

## Basic Concepts

Start here to learn what testing can and can't do, and how to think about building useful tests.

## Writing Unit Tests

Unit testing is how experienced developers check their code as they build it and re-check it as they modify it.
This tutorial will show you how to create and run unit tests using the testthat library.

## Testing in Production

It doesn't matter how careful you were when writing your code if someone then feeds it data that doesn't make sense.
This tutorial will show you how to use checkr to inspect the data flowing through your pipeline so that you can sleep easily at night.
